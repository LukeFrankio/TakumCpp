/**
 * @file phi_bench.h
 * @brief Minimal inline benchmarking utilities for Φ evaluation performance analysis.
 *
 * This header provides lightweight benchmarking tools specifically designed for
 * measuring and analyzing the performance of Φ (Gaussian-log) evaluation methods
 * during Phase-4 development. The utilities are designed to be header-only and
 * compile only when explicitly included, keeping the core library free from
 * timing infrastructure dependencies.
 *
 * DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
 * =================
 * - Header-only: No compilation overhead unless explicitly used
 * - Minimal dependencies: Only requires <chrono> when benchmarking is needed
 * - Precision-aware: Template-based design allows precision-specific measurements
 * - Integration-friendly: Works seamlessly with existing Φ evaluation infrastructure
 *
 * USAGE GUIDELINES:
 * ================
 * This header should only be included in dedicated benchmark translation units
 * to avoid introducing timing overhead in production code. The benchmarking
 * utilities provide:
 * - High-resolution timing for micro-benchmarks
 * - Domain sweeping for comprehensive evaluation testing
 * - Template-based precision targeting for comparative analysis
 *
 * PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT STRATEGY:
 * ================================
 * The benchmarking tools use std::chrono::high_resolution_clock for maximum
 * timing precision and repeatability. Results are returned in nanoseconds to
 * provide sufficient granularity for analyzing small performance differences
 * between evaluation methods.
 *
 * @note Include only in benchmark code to avoid timing infrastructure overhead
 * @note Results may vary based on system load and CPU frequency scaling
 * @note Multiple runs recommended for statistical significance

/**
 * @brief High-precision timing utility for micro-benchmark measurements.
 *
 * Executes a given function multiple times and measures the total elapsed time
 * using high-resolution system timers. This utility is designed for measuring
 * the performance of fast operations like Φ evaluations that require precise
 * timing to distinguish between different implementation strategies.
 *
 * MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY:
 * =======================
 * The function uses std::chrono::high_resolution_clock to minimize timing
 * overhead and maximize measurement precision. The timing loop executes the
 * target function multiple times to amortize the overhead of timer calls and
 * provide statistically meaningful results.
 *
 * USAGE RECOMMENDATIONS:
 * =====================
 * - Use sufficient iterations (1000+) to amortize timing overhead
 * - Run multiple measurements and compute statistics (mean, std dev)
 * - Consider CPU frequency scaling and system load effects
 * - Warm up caches with preliminary runs before measurement
 *
 * @tparam F Function type (deduced automatically from argument)
 * @param f Function or lambda to benchmark (should be callable with no arguments)  
 * @param iters Number of iterations to execute (default: 1000)
 * @return Total elapsed time in nanoseconds for all iterations
 * 
 * @note Return value is total time, not per-iteration time
 * @note Function f should avoid side effects that could affect subsequent iterations
 * @note Consider compiler optimizations that might eliminate dead code

/**
 * @brief Domain sweeping utility for comprehensive Φ evaluation testing.
 *
 * Performs a systematic sweep across the Φ function domain [-0.5, 0.5] and
 * accumulates the results. This utility is useful for:
 * - Performance testing across the full input range
 * - Validation of monotonicity and continuity properties
 * - Cache warming and memory access pattern analysis
 * - Integration testing of evaluation methods
 *
 * SWEEPING STRATEGY:
 * =================
 * The function uniformly samples the domain [-0.5, 0.5] using the specified
 * number of sample points. Each sample is evaluated using the template-specified
 * precision N, and results are accumulated to prevent compiler optimization
 * from eliminating the computation.
 *
 * PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS APPLICATIONS:
 * ==================================
 * - Memory bandwidth utilization for LUT-based methods
 * - Branch prediction effects in piecewise polynomial evaluation
 * - Cache locality analysis for different evaluation strategies
 * - Validation of consistent performance across domain intervals
 *
 * @tparam N Takum precision (bit width) for Φ evaluation  
 * @param samples Number of uniformly distributed sample points (default: 1024)
 * @return Sum of all Φ evaluation results (prevents dead code elimination)
 *
 * @note Return value is primarily to prevent optimization; actual values may not be meaningful
 * @note Uniform sampling ensures consistent coverage of all evaluation intervals
 * @note Template parameter N determines which evaluation strategy is used
